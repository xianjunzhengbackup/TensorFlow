00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.659
when you implement back-propagation for

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
your neural network you need to really

3
00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.550
compute the slope or the derivative of

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.440
the activation functions so let's take a

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.840
look at our choices of activation

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.120
functions and how you can compute the

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.880
slope of these functions you can see

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.300
familiar sigmoid activation function and

9
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.670
so for any given value of z maybe this

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.580
value of z this function will have some

11
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
slope or some derivative corresponding

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.199
to if you draw a rule line there you

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.460
know the height over with there's no

14
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.890
triangle here so if G of Z is the

15
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.719
sigmoid function then the slope of the

16
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.750
function is e VZ G of Z and so we know

17
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.610
from calculators that the disss slope of

18
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.230
G of X and V and if you are familiar

19
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.420
with calculus and know how to take

20
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.879
derivatives if you take the derivative

21
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.309
of the sigmoid function it is possible

22
00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.530
to show that it is equal to this formula

23
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.750
and again I'm not going to do the

24
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.760
calculus steps but if you're familiar

25
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.340
with calculus do for you to pause the

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.430
video and try to prove this yourself and

27
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.030
so this is equal to just G of Z times 1

28
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.170
minus G of Z so let's just sanity check

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.689
that this expression makes sense

30
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.610
first if Z is very large so say Z is

31
00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.189
equal to 10 then G of Z will be close to

32
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.049
1 and so the formula we have on the Left

33
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:42.240
tells us that D DZ G of Z does be close

34
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.149
to G of Z which is equal to 1 times 1

35
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.119
minus 1 which is therefore very close to

36
00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.990
0 and this isn't d correct because when

37
00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.090
Z is very large the slope is close to 0

38
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.180
conversely of Z is equal to minus 10 so

39
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.509
there's no way out there then G of Z is

40
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.110
close to 0 so the following on the left

41
00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.140
tells us d DZ G of Z will be close to G

42
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.690
of Z which is 0 times 1 line is 0 and so

43
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.670
this is also very close to 0 which is

44
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.740
correct

45
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.610
finally at Z is equal to 0

46
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.040
then G of Z is equal to 1/2 that's a

47
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.170
sigmoid function right here and so the

48
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.920
derivative is on equal to 1/2 times 1

49
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.130
minus 1/2 which is equal to 1/4 and that

50
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.570
actually is turns out to be the correct

51
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.760
value of the derivative or the slope of

52
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.160
this function when Z is equal to 0

53
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.130
finally just to introduce one more piece

54
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.980
of notation sometimes instead of writing

55
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.190
this thing the shorthand for the

56
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.120
derivative is G prime of Z so G prime of

57
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.790
Z in calculus the the little dash on top

58
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
is called prime but so G prime of Z is a

59
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.740
shorthand for the in calculus for the

60
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.890
derivative of the function of G with

61
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:08.910
respect to the input variable Z um and

62
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:13.350
then in a new network we have a equals G

63
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.030
of Z right equals this then this formula

64
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.950
also simplifies to a times 1 minus a so

65
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.430
sometimes the implementation you might

66
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.400
see something like G prime of Z equals a

67
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.880
times 1 minus a and that just refers to

68
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.340
you know the observation that G prime

69
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.530
which is used derivative is equal to

70
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.360
this over here and the advantage of this

71
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.690
formula is that if you've already

72
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.280
computed the value for a then by using

73
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
this expression you can very quickly

74
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.620
compute the value for the slope for G

75
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.930
prime s alright so that was the sigmoid

76
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.720
activation function let's now look at

77
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.810
the 10h activation function similar to

78
00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:02.130
what we had previously the definition of

79
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:06.570
d DZ G of Z is the slope of G of Z as a

80
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.270
particular point of Z and if you look at

81
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.600
the formula for the hyperbolic tangent

82
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.430
function and if you know calculus you

83
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.799
can take derivatives and show that this

84
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.799
simplifies to this formula

85
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.830
and using the own shorthand we have

86
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.010
previously when we call this G prime of

87
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.900
Z you gain so if you want you can sanity

88
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.410
check that this formula make sense so

89
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.669
for example if Z is equal to 10 10 H of

90
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:44.639
Z will be very close to 1 this goes from

91
00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.889
plus 1 to minus 1 and then G prime of Z

92
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.350
according to this formula will be about

93
00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.320
1 minus 1 squared so during 3 closes

94
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.050
zero so that was a Z is very large the

95
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.230
slope is close to zero conversely a Z is

96
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.250
very small say Z is equal to minus 10

97
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.510
then 10 H of Z will be close to minus 1

98
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.570
and so G prime of Z will be close to 1

99
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.020
minus negative 1 squared so it's close

100
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.350
to 1 minus 1 which is also close to 0

101
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:20.160
and finally is equal to 0 then 10 H of Z

102
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.260
is equal to 0 and then the slope is

103
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.750
actually equal to 1 which is which

104
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.590
selection the slope point on Z is equal

105
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.140
to 0 so just to summarize if a is equal

106
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.380
to G of Z so if a is equal to this

107
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.370
challenge of Z then the derivative G

108
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.620
prime of Z is equal to 1 minus a squared

109
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.020
so once again if you've already computed

110
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.600
the value of a you can use this formula

111
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.789
to very quickly compute the derivative

112
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.350
as well finally here's how you compute

113
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.020
the derivatives for the value and

114
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.340
looky-loo activation functions for the

115
00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.120
value g of z is equal to max of 0 comma

116
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:04.710
Z so the derivative is equal to you

117
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:09.840
turns out to be 0 if Z is less than 0

118
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.390
and 1 if Z is greater than 0 and is

119
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.610
actually our undefined

120
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.000
technically undefined the G is equal to

121
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.130
exactly 0 but um if you're implementing

122
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.690
this in software it might not be a

123
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.169
hundred percent mathematically correct

124
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.270
but the work just fine if you V is

125
00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.580
exactly really zero if you set the

126
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.340
derivative to be equal to 1 or this had

127
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.300
to be 0 it kind of doesn't matter if

128
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.490
you're an excellent

129
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.710
nation technically G prime then becomes

130
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.750
what's called a sub gradient of the

131
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.449
activation function G of Z which is why

132
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.699
gradient descent still works but you can

133
00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.770
think of it as that the chance of Z

134
00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.690
being you know zero point exactly those

135
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.000
or those of those or zero is so small

136
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.280
that it almost doesn't matter what you

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.349
set the derivative to be equal to when Z

138
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.990
is equal to zero so in practice this is

139
00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:01.259
what people implement for the derivative

140
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.060
of Z and finally if you are training on

141
00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:07.139
your own network with the we here a Lou

142
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:14.759
activation function then G of Z is going

143
00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:20.280
to be max of say 0.01 Z comma Z and so G

144
00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:26.280
prime of Z is equal to 0.01 that Z is

145
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:27.900
less than 0 and 1 if Z is greater than 0

146
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.460
and once again the gradient is

147
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.919
technically not defined when Z is

148
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.289
exactly equal to 0 but some maybe

149
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.000
implement a piece of code that sets the

150
00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:39.330
derivative or the assess G prime Z

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.039
either a 0.01 or to 1 either way it

152
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.560
doesn't really matter when Z is exactly

153
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.750
0 your co-workers so arms of these

154
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.580
formulas you should either compute the

155
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.490
slopes or the derivatives of your

156
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.469
activation assumptions now we have this

157
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.389
building blocks you're ready to see how

158
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:56.159
to implement gradient descent for your

159
00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.940
neural network let's go onto the next

160
00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:58.940
video to see that
